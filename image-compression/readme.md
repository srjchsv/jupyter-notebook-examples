## Examining diffrerent images compression types

Having 5 jpeg images:

    eachfile_compression_bz2 size: 914150
    compression difference: 1.53%

    directory_compression_tar size: 889279
    compression difference: 4.21%

compression of full directory is more effective in this example.

Let me know if you know better options.
